# Python Scripts

Python scripts to automate random stuff that I need or that I'm curious about.
Usually created when I'm exploring new packages and projects.

* Accept LOL Game Automation - automatically locates LOL "Accept" button on screen and click in it
* Memes Generator - generate memes by providing an image and a caption as inputs
* Password Generator - generates a strong password randomly
* Resize All Images - Resize all the images in a given directory (used for memes generator)
